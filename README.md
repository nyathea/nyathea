Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## What I'm Working On

- **[LegacyBird](https://github.com/nyathea/LegacyBird)**<br>
  Tweak for legacy Twitter/X versions so they work once again. Using compatibility fixes, this project brings life back to older twitter versions.

- **[NeoFreeBird](https://github.com/actuallyaridan/NeoFreeBird)**<br>
  A tweaked iOS app that restores old Twitter icons, language bundles, and more from old Twitter versions. It also includes a modified BHTwitter fork with some new features. this started out as my project "FreeBird" back in early 2024
