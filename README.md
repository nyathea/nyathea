## What I'm Working On

- Working on `TwitterLegacyPatcher` which is an big effort to tweak old Twitter/X versions to work again in modern day. with the use of compatibility fixes and an api shim that makes it possible to use it on older devices again after being broken in early 2025.
- Supporting development of `NeoFreeBird`, which is an Tweaked iOS app that restores the old twitter icons, language bundles, and more from older Twitter versions. it also includes an modified BHTwitter with a couple of new features as well. originally started as an project from me called `FreeBird` in 2024.
- I will soon dive into Swift and iOS development as well
